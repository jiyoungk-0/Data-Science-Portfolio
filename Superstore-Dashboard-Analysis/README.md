This dashboard provides an insightful overview of Superstore's sales, profitability, customer behaviour, and shipping performance from 2014 to 2018. It serves as a tool for stakeholders to identify key trends, high-performing products, regional opportunities, and operational inefficiencies to support data-driven decision-making across departments.

### **üí° Why This Project**

In the highly competitive retail environment, understanding customer behavior, identifying top-performing products, and optimizing shipping efficiency are critical to success. This project was created to transform raw sales data into actionable insights, helping stakeholders in sales, marketing, operations, and customer service make informed, strategic decisions.

## Data Analysis Results

In this project, I performed various analyses to understand the impact of discounts on sales and profit.

### 1. A/B Test Results

We compared sales and profit for products with and without discounts:

- **Sales with Discount**: Average sales increased from 227 to 234 units.
- **Profit with Discount**: Profit decreased significantly from 67.7 to -7.5.

### 2. T-Test Results for Sales

We performed a t-test to determine if the difference in sales was statistically significant. The p-value for sales was **0.61**, indicating no significant difference in sales between products with and without discounts.

### 3. T-Test Results for Profit

For profit, the t-test resulted in a p-value of **< 2.2e-16**, which is less than 0.05, indicating that the difference in profit between discounted and non-discounted products is statistically significant.

### 4. Regression Analysis

We performed linear regression to understand how discounts affect profit:

- **Regression Coefficient for Discount**: The coefficient was **-256.79**, meaning that for each unit increase in discount, profit decreases by approximately 256.79.
- **R-squared**: The model explains about 5% of the variance in profit, suggesting that other factors may be influencing profit.

### 5. Optimal Discount Prediction

Based on the regression model, the optimal discount for maximizing profit was predicted to be **0** (i.e., no discount).

### 6. Regional Differences in Discount Impact

The analysis also showed that the effect of discounts varies by region:
- **East & South Regions**: Discounts have a more negative impact on profit.
- **West Region**: No significant effect of discounts on profit.
